Time to learn Git Hub

Hi

Long time admirer of techies and excel tinkerer. Finally have started learning how to do things 'properly' and doing various courses.

I'm building on my excel skills and starting with SQL & R and will move on to learning Python when feel have got the basics of the others sorted.

Have started my more organised learning with Google's Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera and fell down the PostgreSQL rabbit hole when got to the captsone project. It's also the capstone project of that certificate that has bought me to GitHub.

Hope to work out how to use and become part of the community that I have so long admired and been fascinated by from afar.
